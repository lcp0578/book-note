## CHAPTER 1 NLP: A Primer
- NLP Tasks
	- Language modeling
		- This is the task of predicting what the next word in a sentence will be based on the history of previous words. The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language. Language modeling is useful for building solutions for a wide variety of problems, such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, and spelling correction.
	- Text classification
		- This is the task of bucketing the text into a known set of categories based on its content. Text classification is by far the most popular task in NLP and is used in a variety of tools, from email spam identification to sentiment analysis.
	- Information extraction
		- As the name indicates, this is the task of extracting relevant information from text, such as calendar events from emails or the names of people mentioned in a social media post.
	- Information retrieval
		- This is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. Applications like Google Search are well-known use cases of information retrieval.
	- Conversational agent
		- This is the task of building dialogue systems that can converse in human languages. Alexa, Siri, etc., are some common applications of this task.
	- Text summarization
		- This task aims to create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the core content and preserving the overall meaning of the text.
	- Question answering
		- This is the task of building a system that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.
	- Machine translation
		- This is the task of converting a piece of text from one language to another. Tools like Google Translate are common applications of this task.
	- Topic modeling
		- This is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. Topic modeling is a common text-mining tool and is used in a wide range of domains, from literature to bioinformatics.
- How NLP, ML, and DL are related
	- Deep learning refers to the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architectures.

- Approaches to NLP
	- The different approaches used to solve NLP problems commonly fall into three categories: heuristics, machine learning, and deep learning.
	- Heuristics-Based NLP
	- Machine Learning for NLP
		- Any machine learning approach for NLP, supervised or unsupervised, can be described as consisting of three common steps: extracting features from text, using the feature representation to learn a model, and evaluating and improving the model.
