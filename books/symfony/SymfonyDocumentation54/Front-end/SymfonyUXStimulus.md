## Stimulus & Symfony UX
- Stimulus: a small JavaScript framework that makes it easy to attach behavior to HTML. It's powerful, and you will love it! 
- Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn’t seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it’s not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it’s designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with **Turbo** to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.

- Symfony even provides packages to add more features to Stimulus. These are called the **Symfony UX** Packages.
- Symfony UX is an initiative and set of libraries to seamlessly integrate JavaScript tools into your application.
- To use Stimulus, first install StimulusBundle:

		$ composer require symfony/stimulus-bundle
