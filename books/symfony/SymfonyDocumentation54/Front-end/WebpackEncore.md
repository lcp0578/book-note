## Webpack Encore
- Encore's job (via Webpack) is simple: to read and follow all of the import statements and create one final app.js (and app.css) that contains everything your app needs. Encore can do a lot more: minify files, pre-process Sass/LESS, support React, Vue.js, etc.
- The `encore_entry_link_tags()` and `encore_entry_script_tags()` functions read from a `public/build/entrypoints.json` file that's generated by Encore to know the exact filename(s) to render.
