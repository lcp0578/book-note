## 9 User Interface Framework Components
- Material UI stands out due to its comprehensive suite of customizable components, adherence to Googleâ€™s Material Design principles, and extensive documentation, making it an optimal choice for developers seeking efficiency and aesthetic coherence in their UI design.
- **Material UI** excels in simplifying the complex process of designing application layouts. By offering a robust set of components, specifically **containers** and **grids**, it empowers developers to efficiently structure and organize UI elements. 
	- **Containers** serve as the foundation, providing a flexible way to encapsulate and align content within the overall layout. 
	- **Grids**, on the other hand, allow more granular control, enabling precise placement and alignment of components across different screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness and consistency
- The `Drawer` component, just like a physical drawer, slides open to reveal content that is easily accessed.
- Material UI comes with a `styled()` function that can be used to create styled components based on JavaScript objects.
- Material UI comes with a default theme. We can use this as the starting point to create our own theme. There are two main steps to creating a new theme in Material UI:
	- 1. Use the `createTheme()` function to customize the default theme settings and return a new theme object.
	- 2. Use the `ThemeProvider` component to wrap our application so that the appropriate theme 
is applied.
