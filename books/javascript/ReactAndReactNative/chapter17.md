## 17 Kick-Starting React Native Projects
- Exploring React Native CLI tools
	- The **React Native CLI** is a tool created by Meta. The project is based on the original CLI tool and has three parts: native iOS and Android projects and a React Native JavaScript app. To get started, you will need either Xcode or Android Studio. One of the main advantages of the React Native CLI is its flexibility. You can connect any library with a Native module or directly write code to the native parts. However, all of this requires at least a basic understanding of mobile development.
	- The **Expo CLI** is just one part of the big ecosystem for developing React Native apps. Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. Built around React Native and native platforms, it allows you to build, deploy, test, and rapidly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from a single JavaScript/TypeScript code base.
		- The Expo framework provides the following:
			- The **Expo CLI**: A command-line tool that can create blank projects, then run, build, and update them.
			- **Expo Go**: An Android and iOS app for running your projects directly on your device (without having to compile and sign native apps) and sharing them with your entire team.
			- **Expo Snack**: The online playground that allows you to develop React Native apps in the browser.
			- **Expo Application Services (EAS)**: A set of deeply integrated cloud services for Expo and React Native applications. Apps can be compiled, signed, and uploaded to stores using EAS in the cloud.
