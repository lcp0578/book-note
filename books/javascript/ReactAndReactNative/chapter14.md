## 14 Unit Testing in React
- **Software testing** is a process aimed at identifying errors and verifying the functionality of a product to ensure its quality. Testing also allows developers and testers to assess the system’s behavior under various conditions and to ensure that new changes have not led to regression, meaning they have not disrupted existing functionality.
- An automated test typically consists of a set of predefined tests and a software product, often referred to as a runner, which launches these tests and analyzes the results to determine the success or failure of each test. In addition to this, automated tests can be used to check performance, stability, security, availability, and compatibility, allowing you to write truly stable, large, and successful projects. That’s why it’s never a good idea to avoid tests; on the contrary, it’s worth getting to know them better and trying to use them in all possible projects.
