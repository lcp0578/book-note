## 6 Type-Checking and Validation with TypeScript
- Props validation is crucial for a few reasons, as follows:
	- **It helps catch errors early in the development process**: If a component receives a prop of an unexpected type, it might not behave as expected, leading to bugs that can be hard to track down. By validating props, we can catch these errors before they cause problems.
	- **Props validation improves code readability**: By looking at a component’s prop types, you can quickly understand what data the component expects to receive. This makes it easier to use and reuse components throughout your application.
	- **Props validation makes components more predictable**: When a component clearly specifies the types of props it expects to receive, it’s easier to understand how the component will behave based on its props.
- **TypeScript** is a statically typed superset of **JavaScript**, developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- **TypeScript** uses a transpiler (a type of compiler) to convert TypeScript code, which browsers can’t understand directly, into JavaScript code, which can run in any environment where JavaScript runs.
- Why use TypeScript?
	- **Catch errors early**: We’ve already discussed it, but it’s worth putting it in the first place on the list. One of the biggest advantages of TypeScript is its ability to catch errors at compile time, before even running the code. This can help prevent many common errors that might not be caught until runtime in regular JavaScript.
	- **Improve code readability**: TypeScript’s type annotations make it clear what kind of values a function expects as arguments or what type of value a function returns. This can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for other developers who might be working on the same code base.
	- **Easier refactoring**: TypeScript’s static typing also makes it easier to refactor code. If you change the type of a variable or the signature of a function, TypeScript can help you find all the places in your code where you need to make corresponding changes.
	- **Community and tooling support**: TypeScript has gained significant popularity in the JavaScript community and is used by many large companies like Microsoft, Google, and Airbnb. This implies that there’s a large community of developers who can provide support and a wealth of resources for learning TypeScript. Additionally, many code editors have excellent support for TypeScript, providing features like autocompletion, type inference, and error highlighting.
	- **Integration with modern frameworks and libraries**: TypeScript integrates well with modern JavaScript frameworks like React and React Native, which have built-in TypeScript definitions, making it easier to build strongly typed applications. Moreover, a vast majority of popular JavaScript libraries have TypeScript definitions available. These definitions, of￾ten contributed by the community, provide type information about the library’s functions and objects, making it easier and safer to use these libraries in your TypeScript projects. This widespread adoption of TypeScript in the JavaScript ecosystem ensures that you can leverage the benefits of TypeScript almost anywhere in your code base.
	- **Increasing job market demand**: The popularity of TypeScript extends beyond just development practices: it’s also increasingly sought after in the job market. Many companies, from start-ups to large corporations, are adopting TypeScript for their projects, and as a result, there’s a growing demand for developers who are proficient in TypeScript. This is particularly true for roles involving React and React Native, where TypeScript is often used for its benefits in scaling and maintaining large code bases. By learning TypeScript, you’re not only gaining a valuable skill for your projects but also making yourself more marketable as a developer.
